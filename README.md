# Regensburg Climbing Spots Web Application

Welcome to the Regensburg Climbing Spots Web Application! This project is being developed as part of a course on full stack development, offered by a guest lecturer from Ireland, at OTH Regensburg. The goal of this application is to provide a platform for users to mark their favorite bouldering and climbing spots around Regensburg on a map.

## Features

- User Registration: Users can create accounts to log in and access the application.
- Interactive Map: The application provides an interactive map where climbing spots can be marked using placemarks.
- Spot Sharing: Users can share their favorite climbing spots with other users.
- Collaboration: Multiple users can collaborate and add placemarks to the map.

## Technologies Used

The Backend of the application is built using Hapi.
For the Database MongoDB is being used.

## Project Structure

This project is divided into two separate GitHub repositories. This is the Backend Repository, containing the server-side code responsible for handling user authentication, data storage, and API endpoints.

## Development Workflow

I'm following a structured GitHub workflow to ensure efficient collaboration and version control:

- **Master Branch**: The master branch contains the stable and production-ready code.
- **Release Branches**: Release branches are created for each significant release, and they are tagged with appropriate version numbers.
- **Dev Branch**: The dev branch serves as the development branch, where features are integrated and tested.
- **Feature Branches**: Each feature is developed in a separate feature branch, allowing for parallel development and easy tracking.
